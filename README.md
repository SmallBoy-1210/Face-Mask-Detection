# Face-Mask-Detection

The project created solves the problem by having a custom vision model trained to identify individuals and tag them as "With Mask" or "Without Mask". The web app hosted using the web app services of azure takes images from the web through their url as input. And displays the image along with the tag and prediction probability. As the model takes images as input we can directly feed real-time footage from the surveillance cameras.The method used for the Custom Vision model in this web app is to show the capability of the model and not feasibility.
